# Library package manual

## Introduction
Long ago I've started to think about how to maintain the large amount of documents on my system which consists of anything textual and other kinds of files like photos, films, music and strips. Storing on disk you can give it a name and store in some place in the hope that you can find it later. You can than also make links to the same data to provide extra information in the form of a filename. This will soon be a problem when the file is placed in another location leaving a dangling shortcut.

I now wanted a solution which does not duplicate any information except for a backup and also not clobbering the filesystem with links to some other location. And here this module and additional programs comes in.

In this document I try to make clear what is needed to build the modules and program.
